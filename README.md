loader get it from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22029562/python-how-to-make-simple-animated-loading-while-process-is-running)  
i don't know how to add progress uploader bar with tqdm  
for some website like httpbin its posible,  
but in this case some site like zippyshare have multipart form data  
for upload it, see in [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13911048/18108149) requests not support with stream upload,  
also i trying with [requests_toolbelt](https://pypi.org/project/requests-toolbelt/) but not working with [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
